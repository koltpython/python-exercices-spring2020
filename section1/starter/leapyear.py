"""
Roman general Julius Caesar introduced the first leap years over 2000 years ago.
But the Julian calendar had only one rule: any year evenly divisible by four would be a leap year.
This formula produced way too many leap years. Still, it was not corrected until the introduction 
of the Gregorian calendar more than 1500 years later.

In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
- The year can be evenly divided by 4;
- If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
- The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Write a program that takes a year from the user and prints whether it is a leap year or not in the Gregorian calendar.

You can assume the user will enter a nonnegative integer value.

Examples:
Please enter a year: 2000
2000 is a leap year.

Please enter a year: 0
0 is a leap year.

Please enter a year: 1900
1900 is a common year.

Please enter a year: 19302
19302 is a common year.

Please enter a year: 2020
2020 is a leap year.
